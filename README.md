## Description

This project is all about building an RAG-based LLM application where we will incorporate external data sources to augment LLM’s capabilities.

- Specifically, we built an assistant that can answer questions about Scikit-learn — a Python framework for predictive data analysis.
  
- The goal here is to make it easier for developers to adopt the latest and most efficient ways to leverage the Scikit-learn framework.
