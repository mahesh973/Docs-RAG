You can use this information to prune the decision tree and obtain a sequence of smaller trees with increasing alpha values.",

If you have reason to believe that your count data has no intercept or if you want to enforce this constraint, you can set this parameter to False.\n3. `max_iter`: This parameter specifies the maximum number of iterations for the solver. If the solver is not converging or taking too long, you can reduce this parameter to stop the solver early.\n4. `normalize`: This parameter indicates whether to normalize the input features. If your features have different scales or ranges, you may want to normalize them to ensure that the PoissonRegressor model treats them equally.\n5. `solver`: This parameter specifies the solver algorithm to use.

Scaling features to comparable scales, such as [0,1] or mean 0 and variance 1, can improve performance by ensuring that all variables are considered predictive.

Loss function: The `loss` parameter can be set to 'squared\\_error' (default) or 'poisson' (for count data).\n2. Learning rate: The `learning_rate` parameter determines the contribution of each tree in the ensemble. A lower learning rate requires more trees to converge to the optimal solution but may result in a better generalization error.\n3. Maximum iterations: The `max_iter` parameter sets the maximum number of trees in the ensemble. Increasing this number can improve the model's performance but also increases the computation time.\n4. Regularization: The `l2_regularization` parameter helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Increasing the regularization strength reduces the complexity of the model but may also decrease its performance.\n5. Maximum leaf nodes: The `max_leaf_nodes` parameter sets the maximum number of leaves in each tree. Limiting the number of leaves can help control the complexity of the model and reduce overfitting.\n6. Early stopping: The `early_stopping` parameter allows the algorithm to stop training when the validation score does not improve for a specified number of iterations (`n_iter_no_change`). This can help reduce overfitting and computation time.\n7. Validation fraction: The `validation_fraction` parameter sets the fraction of the training data used for validation during early stopping. A higher validation fraction can improve the reliability of early stopping but reduces the size of the training set.\n8. Scoring: The `scoring` parameter sets the metric used to evaluate the model's performance. When using a custom loss function, ensure that it is compatible with the chosen scoring metric.\n\nWhen switching from 'squared\\_error' to 'poisson' loss, consider the following additional considerations:\n\n1. Data type: The 'poisson' loss is appropriate for count data, i.e., non-negative integer values.\n2.

It is performed by considering a certain number of neighbors for each point, limiting the distance of neighbors to return, choosing the number of coordinates for the manifold, and selecting an eigen solver.
