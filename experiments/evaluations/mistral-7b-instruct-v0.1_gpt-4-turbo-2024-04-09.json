This method computes the pruning path during minimal cost-complexity pruning, which is a method for pruning decision trees that aims to minimize the cost of the pruned tree while preserving its complexity. The `cost_complexity_pruning_path` method takes in the input data `X`, target variable `y`, and optional `sample_weight` as arguments and returns the pruning path.

Additionally, manually setting one of the environment variables (OMP_NUM_THREADS, MKL_NUM_THREADS, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS, or BLIS_NUM_THREADS) will take precedence over what joblib tries to do, thus providing finer control over the number of threads.",

In this case, it is set to 1, which corresponds to a Poisson distribution.\n2. `alpha`: This parameter is used to control the regularization strength. A smaller value of alpha leads to a stronger regularization, which can help prevent overfitting.\n3. `fit_request`: This parameter specifies the type of optimization algorithm to use for fitting the model. The default value is 'liblinear', which is a fast and efficient algorithm for linear models.\n4. `score_request`: This parameter specifies the type of optimization algorithm to use for scoring the model. The default value is 'liblinear', which is the same as the `fit_request` parameter.\n\nThese parameters can be set when creating an instance of the PoissonRegressor class, or they can be tuned using cross-validation to find the optimal values for the given dataset.",

The optimal scaling factor is determined via maximum likelihood estimation in both the Yeo-Johnson and Box-Cox transforms. PowerTransformer supports both positive or negative data, with the Box-Cox transform requiring input data to be strictly positive. By default, zero-mean, unit-variance normalization is applied to the transformed data. PowerTransformer should be used when normality of the features in a dataset is desired, in order to stabilize variance and minimize skewness, which can improve the performance of many modeling scenarios.",

Using trigonometric features for higher harmonics or additional trigonometric features for the natural period with different phases could potentially fix this problem.",

Failing to account for multicollinearity: When two or more features are highly correlated, the coefficients may be unstable and difficult to interpret. In such cases, it may be necessary to use regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to reduce multicollinearity.\n5. Not considering the model's performance: The coefficients may be useful for understanding the relationship between the features and the target variable, but they do not necessarily indicate the model's overall performance.

The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying weights to the weak learners.
