You can use L1 (`alpha_L1 > 0`) or L2 (`alpha_L2 > 0`) regularization or both (`alpha_L1` and `alpha_L2` as non-negative numbers) to prevent overfitting.\n2. `power`: Set it to 1 to specify the Poisson distribution. PoissonRegressor is equivalent to TweedieRegressor with `power=1` and a log link function.\n\nThese parameters can help you control the model's complexity and fit the data better. You can fine-tune them using cross-validation and other optimization techniques to achieve optimal performance.",

Increase the sparsity of the random projection matrix by reducing its density parameter (`density`). This can help reduce computation time and memory usage.\n2. Use the `inverse_transform` method to recover the original high-dimensional data from the transformed low-dimensional data. This can be useful for debugging or visualization purposes.\n3. Consider using alternative sparse random projection methods, such as those implemented in `sklearn.random_projection.SparseRandomProjection`, if they are more suitable for your specific use case.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these optimization techniques may depend on the specific characteristics of your high-dimensional data.

Here is an example:\n```\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import PairwiseKernel\n\nkernel = PairwiseKernel(metric='rbf', gamma=0.1)\n```\nYou can also specify other parameters for the chosen kernel by passing a dictionary as the `pairwise_kernels_kwargs` parameter. For example, if you want to specify the degree and coef0 parameters for a polynomial kernel, you can do the following:\n```\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import PairwiseKernel\n\npairwise_kwargs = {'degree': 3, 'coef0': 1}\nkernel = PairwiseKernel(metric='poly', gamma=0.1, pairwise_kernels_kwargs=pairwise_kwargs)\n```\nThe `gamma_bounds` parameter can be used to set the lower and upper bounds on the value of gamma during hyperparameter tuning. If set to `'fixed'`, the value of gamma cannot be changed during tuning.\n```\nkernel = PairwiseKernel(metric='rbf', gamma=0.1, gamma_bounds=(1e-5, 1e5))\n```",

This is done after the tree has been constructed, hence the name 'post-pruning'. One common method for post-pruning is cost complexity pruning, which involves evaluating the complexity of the tree and the cost of misclassifying examples, and removing branches that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy of the tree.",

This is done using cost complexity pruning, which is parameterized by the cost complexity parameter, ccp_alpha. Greater values of ccp_alpha increase the number of nodes pruned. The process involves recursively finding the node with the 'weakest link', characterized by an effective alpha, and pruning the nodes with the smallest effective alpha first.

This can be useful in cases where there is a large number of features, and it is necessary to focus on a subset that is known to be relevant.

This technique is particularly useful for non-linear or opaque estimators and can provide a measure of the variance in the estimated feature importances for the specific trained model.
