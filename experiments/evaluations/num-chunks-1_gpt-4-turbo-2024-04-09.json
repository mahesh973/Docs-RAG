However, scikit-learn does not provide a built-in function to directly perform cost complexity pruning on decision trees.

Note that you'll need to replace `X_train`, `y_train`, and `X_test` with your actual data.\n\nSimilarly, you can use `plot_partial_dependence` to visualize the relationship between the features and the target variable:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.inspection import plot_partial_dependence\n\n# Plot partial dependence for the first feature\nfig, ax = plot_partial_dependence(clf, X_train, features=[0])\n```\n\nThis will create a plot showing the relationship between the first feature and the target variable.

            "generated_answer": " Isomap embedding is particularly useful in scenarios where you have high-dimensional data and you suspect that it lies on a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold. It works by preserving the geodesic distances between points, rather than the Euclidean distances used in linear methods like PCA. Isomap embedding is performed using the Isomap algorithm, which involves three steps:\n\n1. Construct a neighborhood graph where each data point is connected to its k-nearest neighbors.\n2. Compute the shortest path between all pairs of points in the graph, which approximates the geodesic distances between points on the manifold.\n3. Use classical MDS to embed the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the geodesic distances.\n\nYou can find more details on how to use the Isomap algorithm in the User Guide.",
            "reference_answer": "Isomap embedding is particularly useful for non-linear dimensionality reduction. It is performed by considering a certain number of neighbors for each point, limiting the distance of neighbors to return, choosing the number of coordinates for the manifold, and selecting an eigen solver. Other parameters such as convergence tolerance, maximum number of iterations for the solver, method for finding the shortest path, and algorithm for nearest neighbors search are also set.",

It correctly identifies the utility of Isomap in handling high-dimensional data that lies on a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold and explains the process involving neighborhood graphs, shortest path computation, and classical MDS. However, it lacks some specific details about parameter settings such as the number of neighbors, eigen solver options, and other algorithmic parameters that are mentioned in the reference answer. This omission makes the answer slightly less comprehensive, hence the score of 4.",

The resulting transformed data will be stored in the `X_transformed` variable.\n\nThis example is based on the commit [#27250](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27250) by [Yao Xiao](https://github.com/Charlie-XIAO).",
