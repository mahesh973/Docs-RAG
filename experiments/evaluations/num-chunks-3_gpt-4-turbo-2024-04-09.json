Oversubscription occurs when a program runs too many threads simultaneously, leading to resource contention and potential degradation in performance. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully manage the number of concurrent tasks to match the available CPU resources.",

This can be done by using the loky backend in joblib, which tells the processes to use max_threads = n_cpus // n_jobs. Additionally, manually setting one of the environment variables (OMP_NUM_THREADS, MKL_NUM_THREADS, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS, or BLIS_NUM_THREADS) will take precedence over what joblib tries to do, thus providing finer control over the number of threads.",

Use an optimized linear algebra library: Sklearn uses the standard NumPy library for linear algebra operations, but you can replace it with a more optimized library like SciPy or MKL.\n\n5.

This is especially true for correlated variables, where the weight is shared between predictive variables, resulting in less influence on the prediction. Therefore, regularization makes the model less sensitive to changes in individual coefficients, and the estimates are more stable.",
