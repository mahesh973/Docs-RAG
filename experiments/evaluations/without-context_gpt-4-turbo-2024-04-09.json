            "reasoning": "The generated answer provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to perform Isomap Embedding using scikit-learn, which is very useful for someone looking to understand the practical implementation. It includes code snippets, which are correct and directly applicable. However, the initial statement about needing more context is unnecessary and might confuse the reader, as the subsequent content is sufficiently clear and complete. The reference answer is much less detailed, only mentioning the function used for Isomap in scikit-learn without any implementation details. The generated answer goes beyond the reference by providing a practical example, which enhances its quality. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate, reflecting the high quality of the answer with a minor deduction for the initial unnecessary remark.",
