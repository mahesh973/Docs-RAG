        "answer": "The metric and gamma parameters for a PairwiseKernel can be specified during the initialization of the class. The gamma parameter is a float with a default value of 1.0, and it should be positive. The gamma_bounds parameter is a pair of floats >= 0 or 'fixed', with a default value of (1e-5, 1e5). The metric parameter can be one of the following: 'linear', 'additive_chi2', 'chi2', 'poly', 'polynomial', 'rbf', 'laplacian', 'sigmoid', 'cosine', or a callable function. The default value for metric is 'linear'.",
