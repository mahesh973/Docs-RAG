If you pass a callable, it should be a function that takes in two arrays and returns a single value representing the distance between them. The function should be vectorized, that is, it should be able to take in arrays of any shape and size and return a valid distance value. Here's an example of how you can use a custom metric:\n```\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef custom_metric(X, Y):\n    # Your custom distance calculation goes here\n    # For example, you can calculate the Euclidean distance between the means of X and Y\n    return np.linalg.norm(X.mean(axis=0) - Y.mean(axis=0))\n\nX = np.random.rand(5, 3)\nY = np.random.rand(5, 3)\n\ndistances = pairwise_distances(X, Y, metric=custom_metric)\n```\nIn this example, the `custom_metric` function calculates the Euclidean distance between the means of the arrays `X` and `Y`.

A higher consensus score suggests a better quality of biclustering, while a lower score implies greater dissimilarity between the two sets.

Loss Function: The choice of loss function depends on the problem at hand. The default loss is 'squared\\_error' for regression tasks. However, if the data follows a Poisson distribution, use the 'poisson' loss, which is now supported.\n2. Learning Rate: A lower learning rate slows down the convergence, but may result in a more accurate model, especially for noisy data.\n3. Max Iterations: The maximum number of iterations (trees) to fit. Increasing this number may improve the model's performance, but also increases the computation time.\n4. Max Leaf Nodes: The maximum number of leaf nodes per tree. More leaf nodes may result in a more complex tree, but may also lead to overfitting.\n5. Max Depth: The maximum depth of the tree. Similar to max leaf nodes, a higher depth may result in a more complex tree and overfitting.\n6. Min Samples Leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node. A higher number reduces overfitting but may result in a less complex tree.\n7. L2 Regularization: Regularization strength to avoid overfitting. A higher value increases the regularization strength.\n8. Max Bins: The maximum number of bins used for the histograms. More bins may result in a more accurate model, but also increase computation time.\n9. Categorical Features: If the dataset contains categorical features, they should be specified here.\n\nFor 'poisson' loss, in particular, it is suitable for tasks where the target variable represents counts and follows a Poisson distribution. It is less sensitive to outliers than 'squared\\_error' loss.",

            "answer": " The error you're encountering is due to how `bsr` and `dok` sparse matrices handle explicit zeros in the `precomputed` metric for `KNeighborsClassifier`. This issue has been reported and discussed in the scikit-learn GitHub repository (#13925 and #15524).\n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Convert your `bsr` or `dok` sparse matrices to another format, such as `csr` or `csc`, which are supported by `KNeighborsClassifier` with `metric='precomputed'`.\n2. If converting the matrix format is not an option, you can try implementing a custom solution by subclassing `KNeighborsClassifier` and modifying the relevant methods (`fit`, `kneighbors`, and `radius_neighbors`) to handle `bsr` and `dok` sparse matrices appropriately.\n\nHere's an example of how to subclass `KNeighborsClassifier` to handle `bsr` and `dok` sparse matrices:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nimport scipy.sparse as sp\n\nclass CustomKNeighborsClassifier(KNeighborsClassifier):\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        if sp.issparse(X) and not sp.isspmatrix_csc(X) and not sp.isspmatrix_csr(X):\n            X = X.tocsc()\n        super().fit(X, y)\n\n    def kneighbors(self, X, n_neighbors, return_distance=True):\n        if sp.issparse(X) and not sp.isspmatrix_csc(X) and not sp.isspmatrix_csr(X):\n            X = X.tocsc()\n        return super().kneighbors(X, n_neighbors, return_distance)\n\n    def radius_neighbors(self, X, radius, return_distance=True):\n        if sp.issparse(X) and not sp.isspmatrix_csc(X) and not sp.isspmatrix_csr(X):\n            X = X.tocsc()\n        return super().radius_neighbors(X, radius, return_distance)\n```\n\nThis custom class converts `bsr` and `dok` sparse matrices to `csc` format before calling the superclass methods.

            "answer": " Spectral embedding is particularly beneficial in scenarios where a non-linear embedding is required. It is applied to non-Euclidean data by first converting the data into a graph, where nodes represent data points and edges represent similarities or relationships between them. The graph is then approximated as a discrete representation, and a spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian is performed to find a low dimensional representation of the data. This approach is useful for data that lies on non-linear manifolds, such as those found in image and speech processing.",
